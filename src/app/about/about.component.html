          <p class="lead">Our festival comes alive along a path symbolizing a cultural journey. At the easternmost part of the festival, you'll find spaces that continue the bardic traditions reminiscent of Soviet-era "fly-ins" — spontaneous camping gatherings celebrated by poetic intellectuals during the later decades of the USSR, filled with the rich, literate sounds of acoustic guitar music.</p>
          <p class="lead">The center stage becomes a melting pot of nostalgic Russian rock blended with Balkan beats, and classic Soviet art-rock from the 1990s.</p>
          <p class="lead">Further west, the festival embraces modern genres like electronic music, dub, experimental theater, and New Age sounds, reflecting the post-Soviet era’s innovative spirit.</p>
          <p class="lead">Throughout the festival grounds, you'll discover countless installations of DIY experimental sculptures and performance art. This participatory, unprogrammed culture encourages attendees to bring and set up their own creations, often to the organizers' delight (or sometimes, their frustration).</p>
          <p class="lead">Wandering through the festival is an adventure in itself, fostering spontaneous interactions and collisions of diverse communities and sub-communities.</p>
          <p class="lead">The atmosphere is one of localized utopia, characterized by joy, openness, and a collaborative problem-solving spirit. Attendees hail from various countries, including Russia and Ukraine, where identities are present but not contentious. This festival represents a vibrant, harmonious convergence of people and cultures, creating a never-ending tapestry of music, workshops, and engaging activities that make for an unforgettable experience.</p>
